;; colon operator works like aget on arrays
(def a [4 5 6 7])
(assert (== 4 (:0 a)))

;; symbol access
(def y 1)
(assert (== 5 (:y a)))

;; function access
(defn g [] 0)
(defn f [] 3)
(assert (== 4 (:(g) a)))
(assert (== 7 (:(f) a)))

;; colon operator works like hget on hashes
(def h {karin:9 heath:10})
(assert (== (:karin h) 9))
(assert (== (:heath h) 10))

;; NB doesn't work because hash expects symbols as keys
;; (defn f [] 'heath)
;; (assert (== (:(f) h) 10))
